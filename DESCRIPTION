The Quantum Guardian Web project is dedicated to crafting a user-friendly web application that serves
as a tangible UI and UX for QKD quantum key distribution (QKD) principles, offering a quantum-safe
encryption alternative to combat eavesdropping and other security threats. The project delves into an
in-depth exploration of vulnerabilities in classic cryptographic methods, actively engaging users in the
QKD process, incorporating essential UI and UX principles and functionalities such as login, registration,
and simulation. The anticipated simulation dashboard outcome will provide not only comprehensive
demonstrations of security and robustness but also provide an automated means to access and interact
with user training materials aimed at enhancing understanding. With an explicit goal of aiding individuals
and organizations in interactively visualizing how QSE use QKD to respond to Quantum threat situations
effectively responding to quantum threat situations, the proposed system aims to seamlessly integrate
QKD principles into a user-friendly web application, enabling active user engagement in the QKD
process.
